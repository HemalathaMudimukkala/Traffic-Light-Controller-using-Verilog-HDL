# Traffic-Light-Controller-using-Verilog-HDL
This project implements a Traffic Light Controller using Verilog HDL, designed to manage traffic flow at a four-way intersection with north, south, east, and west directions. The controller operates as a finite state machine (FSM) with eight states, including green and yellow light phases for each direction. The system transitions through these states in a predefined sequence, with each direction receiving a green light followed by a yellow light before control passes to the next direction. Timing for state transitions is managed by a counter, ensuring that green lights last longer than yellow lights. The controllerâ€™s outputs directly control the traffic lights, where green is represented by 3'b001, yellow by 3'b010, and red by 3'b100. The design is verified through a testbench that simulates various scenarios, ensuring correct light sequencing and timing. This project serves as a practical example of digital design applied to traffic management at intersections.
